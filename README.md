### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Michael, and I'm currently attending the University of Virginia as a graduate student. I'm pursuing an M.S. in Computer Engineering, and a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from the Darden School of Business, with an intended graduation date of spring 2028. I'm interested in open source software, dependable computing, hardware/software co-design and building useful tools.

Before this, I spent ten years as an enlisted sailor in the nuclear submarine community. In 2025, I graduated from Penn State - World Campus with a B.S. in Software Engineering.

More information about myself can be found at my [website](https://www.mshires.net) along with a blog where I post whatever comes across my mind.

That's it! Have a look around and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to chat. I'm always available at michael@mshires.net
