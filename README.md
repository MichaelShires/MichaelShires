### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Michael. 27 years old and finishing up a decade of service in the nuclear navy. I'm also a remote software engineering undergraduate student at Pennsylvania State University. Conveniently, I finish up both of those chapters of my life in the spring of 2025.

After that, I plan on pursuing graduate school using my G.I. Bill. I'm deeply interested in the fields of dependable computing and computer architecture, and how we can make computers both more reliable for use in critical applications, and how computers can continue to see the exponential growth of the last 40 years as quantum effects start coming into play with the size of transistors decreasing below the nanometer scale.

Beyond that, I'm married to my wife Emma, and have a cat and a dog, named Ham and Izzie. More information about myself can be found at my website, mshires.net along with a blog where I post whatever comes across my mind. This is my only outlet as I don't use social media, so bear with me.

That's it! Have a look around and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to chat! I'm always available at michael@mshires.net
