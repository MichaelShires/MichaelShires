### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Michael, and I'm currently a SkillBridge intern with [Context Ventures](https://contextvc.com). Before this, I spent ten years as an enlisted sailor in the nuclear submarine community. I'm also a senior at Penn State University - World Campus, pursuing a B.S. software engineering.

In the fall, I will be attending the University of Virginia for an M.S. in Computer Engineering and MBA dual masters program, to graduate in spring of 2028. I'm interested in open source software, dependable computing, hardware/software co-design and building useful tools.

More information about myself can be found at my [website](https://www.mshires.net) along with a blog where I post whatever comes across my mind.

That's it! Have a look around and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to chat. I'm always available at michael@mshires.net
